	<br/>
	<p>
		HappyLibs! is a free word game that emulates the popular word game Mad Libs&#x2122, created by Roger Price and Leonard Stern.
		Simply enter the required words in the form and they will be inserted into a short story or poem, often producing something
		silly, goofy, or strange.

		HappyLibs! was created by Haley Mnatzaganian using Java and Spring MVC as a fun way to learn some new programming technologies.
